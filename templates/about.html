        <p>Hi, my name is Réka Gábosi. I’m currently working as a project manager in civil engineering, but I’m transitioning my career into AI engineering — building intelligent systems with Python, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks.</p>

        <p>Since December 2024, I have been completing advanced AI programs, including <strong>IBM’s AI Engineering</strong>, <strong>IBM’s Generative AI Engineering</strong>, and <strong>Harvard University’s CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</strong>. These programs gave me hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Flask, and SQLite — developing and deploying projects in NLP, RAG systems, computer vision, and generative AI, many of which I’ve shared on GitHub.</p>

        <p>While my professional background is in civil engineering, the skills I’ve built there — structured problem-solving, designing systems that last, and leading multidisciplinary projects — translate directly into AI engineering. Whether managing complex construction projects or building scalable AI solutions, I approach challenges with logic, structure, and long-term impact in mind.</p>

        <p>Cybersecurity has also become a side focus of mine. With AI evolving, so do its risks, which is why I completed <strong>AI Security: Risks, Defences and Safety</strong> with Macquarie University. It strengthened my understanding of how to build and deploy AI systems responsibly and securely.</p>

        <p>I am actively seeking opportunities to transition into AI engineering. I’m especially motivated to join a team where I can apply my technical skills, continue growing as an engineer, and contribute to meaningful, future-driven projects.</p>
