          Hi, my name is Réka Gábosi. I’m an aspiring <strong>AI / Machine Learning Engineer</strong> with a background in civil engineering and project management, currently transitioning into building intelligent, scalable, and secure AI systems using Python, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since December 2024, I have been completing advanced AI-focused programs, including 
          <strong>IBM’s AI Engineering</strong>, 
          <strong>IBM’s Generative AI Engineering</strong>, and 
          <strong>Harvard University’s CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</strong>.
          Through these programs, I gained hands-on experience developing and deploying real-world projects involving 
          <strong>machine learning pipelines, deep learning models, NLP applications, RAG systems, computer vision</strong>, and <strong>generative AI</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical toolkit includes <strong>Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Flask, and SQLite</strong>, with a strong focus on building end-to-end AI solutions — from data processing and model training to deployment and inference. Many of these projects are publicly available on my GitHub.
        </p>

        <p>
          To support production-ready AI systems, I have also completed the 
          <strong>Packt Docker and Kubernetes Masterclass: From Beginner to Advanced</strong>. 
          This strengthened my ability to containerize machine learning applications, manage dependencies, and deploy scalable AI services using <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong> — skills essential for modern MLOps and real-world AI deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cybersecurity is an important complementary focus in my work, particularly in the context of <strong>securing AI models and ML systems</strong>. 
          I completed <strong>AI Security: Risks, Defences and Safety</strong> with Macquarie University, where I explored topics such as adversarial threats, model vulnerabilities, data leakage, and responsible AI deployment. This has shaped how I think about building AI systems that are not only effective, but also robust, secure, and trustworthy.
        </p>

        <p>
          While my professional background is rooted in civil engineering, it has given me a strong foundation in <strong>structured problem-solving, system-level thinking, and managing complex projects</strong>. These skills translate naturally into AI engineering, where scalability, reliability, and long-term impact are just as critical as model performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am actively seeking opportunities to transition into an <strong>AI / Machine Learning Engineering</strong> role. I am motivated to join a team where I can contribute to building intelligent systems, grow as an engineer, and work on meaningful, future-focused technologies.
