## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This portfolio was designed to reflect both technical competence and creative clarity. The layout is clean and minimalist, with each section thoughtfully organized to highlight key experiences and skills without overwhelming the visitor.  

Key design principles:
- **Responsive Design**: Works well across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Split-Screen Introduction**: Highlights dual paths in civil engineering and programming.
- **Consistent Visual Style**: Typography, spacing, and color themes are unified across pages.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, embedded links, and clickable images for engagement.
- **Separation of Concerns**: HTML templates, static assets, and logic are modular and maintainable.
